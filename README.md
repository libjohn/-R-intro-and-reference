# Introduction to [R]

I drafted this [Introduction to R](https://www.johnlittle.info/project/custom/r-tips/intro-to-r) document to help me learn while also answering FAQ questions -- which I hear more frequently from new [R] users.  The focus is geared toward beginners who need to use [R] for data-smithing. There is more emphasis on data wrangling and little on statistical methodology.  

Since writing this document I've come to prefer the [*tidyverse*](http://tidyverse.org/) method as the best place to start when learning R.  And to that end I have a [newer resource to **use first**](http://rpubs.com/libjohn/intro2r-dvs).  But I'm keeping this one around because it has a few useful tips to keep in mind.

The sections are:

1. Begin - Intro to R
2. The Wow Factor
3. Data Structure Types
4. Variable Assignment
5. Data Management
6. Identify and Display
7. Data Wrangling with dplyr
8. Tables - Cross Tabulations
9. Visualizations
10. Resources
11. References
