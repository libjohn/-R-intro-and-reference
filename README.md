# Introduction to [R]

I drafted this document to answer questions I hear most frequently from new [R] users.  The focus is geared toward beginers who need to use [R] for datasmithing. There is more emphasis on data wrangling and little on stastical methodology.  

The sections are:

1. Begin - Intro to R
2. The Wow Factor
3. Data Structure Types
4. Variable Assignment
5. Data Management
6. Identify and Display
7. Data Wrangling with dplyr
8. Tables - Cross Tabulations
9. Visualizations
10. Resources
11. References

I recommend reading the HTML version of the document, found in the _output_ directory.

Another good option is to load and run the Rmarkdown script, found in the _scripts_ directory.
