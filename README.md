# Introduction to [R]

I drafted this [Intro to R document](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/libjohn/R-intro-and-reference/blob/master/output/Intro_to_R.html) to answer questions I hear most frequently from new [R] users.  The focus is geared toward beginners who need to use [R] for data-smithing. There is more emphasis on data wrangling and little on statistical methodology.  

The sections are:

1. Begin - Intro to R
2. The Wow Factor
3. Data Structure Types
4. Variable Assignment
5. Data Management
6. Identify and Display
7. Data Wrangling with dplyr
8. Tables - Cross Tabulations
9. Visualizations
10. Resources
11. References

I recommend reading the [HTML version](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/libjohn/R-intro-and-reference/blob/master/output/Intro_to_R.html) of the document (found in the _output_ directory)

Another good option is to load and run the Rmarkdown script, found in the _scripts_ directory.
