## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r mcgrtr}
foesx <-   
  mutate(mtcars, rownames(mtcars)) %>% 
  rename(makeMo = `rownames(mtcars)`) %>% 
  select(makeMo, mpg:wt ) %>% 
  mutate(dispwt = disp / wt) %>% 
  filter(cyl >= 4, cyl <=6) %>% 
  filter(mpg < 28)
```


```{r read-filter}
starbucks <- 
  read_csv("https://opendata.socrata.com/api/views/ddym-zvjk/rows.csv") # %>% 
#  filter(grepl("NC|NH", State))
```

```{r count}
tbl_df(starbucks)  %>% 
  filter(City == "Lexington")  %>% 
  count(City, State)
```
