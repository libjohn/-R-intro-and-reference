The intended audience are students signed up for the [Data & Visualization Department](http://library.duke.edu/data/) [Workshop Series](http://library.duke.edu/data/news): _Introduction to R_.  The first section of this document loads preliminary libraries.  If you don't need to know this now, **Skip ahead**  to [Begin - Intro to R](#begin).

## Library Packages
Load all the packages for this tutorial. Strictly speaking this is a two step process:  (1) install the package; (2) load the package.  I'll include the install commands for [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility), but you can probably skip to simply loading the packages.  If any package  doesn't load, you can uncomment the "install.packages" command for that package (remove the `#` preceding the relevant `install.packages` command.)  Then, rerun the relevant code-chucks.  

A **note** about the number of packages.  The necessary packages that make up the bulk of concepts taught in this workshop are: **readr**,  **dplyr**, and **ggplot2**.  stringr, and stringi are for string manipulation but we won't go into great depth as to their use.  The rmarkdown package is a utility that allows me to compose this workshop and create code-chunks.  All of the code-chunks can be run just as well in a raw 'r' script.

```{r}
# If you do not have these packages already installed in your packages list, you can install them by uncommenting the following lines.
#
# install.packages("rmarkdown")
# install.packages("readr")		
# install.packages("dplyr")		
# install.packages("ggplot2") 
# install.packages("stringr")
# install.packages("stringi")


# Load packages required for this workshop
require(rmarkdown)  # R specific implementation of markdown.  helpful in generating an HTML output document - https://github.com/hadley/rmarkdown
require(readr)      # read tabular data into R - https://github.com/hadley/readr
require(dplyr)      # working with data frames - https://github.com/hadley/dplyr
require(ggplot2)    # popular visualization package - https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2
require(stringr)
require(stringi)
```

## Hadleyverse
These days, much of what we try to accomplish within the data universe requires reshaping the data.  The various reshaping activies occur with almost astounding frequency among datasmiths.  Much of this activity has been identified as the _Split-Apply-Combine Strategy_[^7] by [Hadley Wickam](http://hadley.nz/).  To that end, Hadley Wickham has authored or coauthored many packages which augment the base-R functionality in support of more convenient data wrangling.  Hadley's efforts have been broadly adopted to the point of earning a nickname for the  suite of packages: "**Hadleyverse**."  You can read more about this in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Hadleverse](http://adolfoalvarez.cl/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-hadleyverse/)[^13] by Adolfo Alvarez. 

We will use many of the Hadleyverse packages in this workshop.  A selection of Hadleyverse packages have been selected and applied in the code-chunk above.

# Begin - Intro to R {#begin}
R is a popular programming environment with embedded statistical capabilities.  The [R] language is also popular as a data science toolset.  If you want to read more about the origins and definitions of [R] try starting at the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).  Our focus in this introduction will develop your skills working in the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE (development environment), data reshaping, generating cross tablulations, and generating rudimentary visualizations.

# Data Structure Types 
The following image, from [_First Steps in R_](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html) (Ceballos & Cardiel)[^1], is a handy visualization to explain the data types available in [R].

![R Data Types](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/_images/dataStructuresNew.png)

As you can see the object orientation of [R] allows you to be specific, atmostic, about object characteristics.  These characteristics are called _Data Types_ or _Data Structures_. This level of specificity can yield sophisticated outcome but may also lead to confusion, especially with those learning R.  For this workshop we'll stick with two very common data types:  Vectors & Data Frames.

## Vectors and Data Frames
 
* **Vectors** are one dimensional arrays in which all values must of the same type:  _Numeric_, _Complex_, _Logical_, or  _Character_
* _Factors_ are vectors used when working with [categorical variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable).
* **Data Frames** are generalized matrices.  Different columns can store different types including vectors, lists, Factors, Arrays, and Functions.
* [More Data Types](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html)

For now, remember you can only store one data type in a Vector *but* you can store multiple vector types in a data frame.  I encourage you to read more about Data Types, later.  Simply put, many [R] road blocks occur when the [R] programmer misunderstands the data structure of a particular data object.  On the other hand, if you're working with statistics, this level of atomization brings critical and useful functionality.


# Variable Assignment
Variable or object names are most commonly assigned using the `<-` operator but there are many equivalent assignment operators.

* Assignment Operators 
    + `<<-` 
    + `<-` 
    + `=` 
    + `->` 
    + `->>`
    
```{r}
# Assign "foo" as a three item character vector:  
foo <- c("apple", "bannana", "grape")     # c() is the "concatenate" function
foo ->> bar

# now recall the value of those objects by name:
foo
bar
```


# Data Management

## Sample data {#sample}
### Overview process
1. Download the sample [UnempData.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5909145?private_link=50e77f2201ac90141e4c) file to a  directory on your local workstation.  **Do this now.**
2. Move or [upload](#upload) the file to your working directory as identified by the command `getwd()`
3. Load that data using assignments and the `read_csv` function
4. Skip now to the section **[R] and your file system** (below)

### Other downloading & loading techniques
**Note**:  You don't need to follow these steps but be aware there many ways to load data

* download a file directory to your working directory
     + `download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5909145?private_link=50e77f2201ac90141e4c", "foo.csv")`
* load a file [via http](#httpload) -- which you will do later in this workshop.  

For now, it's also important to understand how [R] works with your local file system.  


## [R] and your file system
### getwd()
Identify [R]'s default data directory.
```{r}
getwd()
```

### setwd()
* You can change the working directory using `setwd()`
    + `setwd("c:/somedir/")`


## Construct filepath/filename variable {#getwd}
In this section, practice working with your file-system environment variables and assigning those values to object names.
```{r}
DIR <- getwd()
filename <- "UnempData.csv"
fullpath <- paste(DIR, "/../data/", filename, sep = '')        # paste() to concatenate vectors

fullpath                          #display the value of fullpath in the console
```

## Where is my data? {#upload}
If you upload data using any of the following methods in RStudio then you can ignore the preceding about manipulating the files-system and directory structure.

* From the Environment/History Pane
      + `Environment Tab > Import Datasets`
* From the Help Pane
      + `Files Tab > Upload`
* From the File menu bar
      + `File > Open File`

## Load a CSV file

In this example we use the `read_csv()` function, part of the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr#readr) library.  I recommend readr because it automatically imports character data as characters without also automatically assign those characters as factors.  This is an improvement over the default "base-R" approach which automatically converts characters to factors whenever [R] thinks that's a good idea.

```{r}
# read the uploaded CSV file into a data frame.
# using the read_csv() function, part of the readr package loaded earlier
# To get help using read_csv() type the following into the console:  ?read_csv [Enter]
unempdata <- read_csv(fullpath)
```

## Other data loaders

There are many other types of data you may want to load such as SAS, SPSS, Stata, Excel, Google Sheets, etc.  Loading packages are available to support many methods.  Some of the more common data types are supported by the following packages:

* foreign - load data from SPSS, SAS, and other Statistical Analysis applications
* readxl - load Excel data
* googlesheets - load data from Google Sheets

# Identify and Display
There are various methods of identifying the descriptive characteristics of data objects in R.

## View() 
Display your data in a grid style within the Source Editor pane ([screenshot](http://paulyeo21.github.io/cell_bio_gen_lab/images/331f4ea3.rstudio_pane.png)). The `View()` function is typed with an *uppercase V*.
```{r}
View(unempdata) 
```

## class() - class of the data type
Identify the data variable characteristics of the data object.
```{r}
class(unempdata)
```

## dim() - dimensions 
Identify the dimensions of the data object.
```{r}
dim(unempdata)

```
> That's 50 rows, or observations, and six columns, or variables.


## nrow() - number of rows
Identify the number of rows in the data object.
```{r}
nrow(unempdata)
```
## ncol() - number of columns
Identify the number of columns in the data object.
```{r}
ncol(unempdata)
```
## str() - Structure
Identify the structure of the data object.
```{r}
str(unempdata)
```
## head() - show top rows
Identify the top rows of the data object.
```{r}
head(unempdata)
```
## tail() - show last rows
Identify the bottom twenty rows of the data object
```{r}
tail(unempdata, 20)   # in this case, show the last 20 rows
```
## summary() - get summary statistics when available 
Identify a statistical summary of the data object.
```{r}
summary(unempdata)
```

## colnames()
List all column names
```{r}
colnames(unempdata)
```

## rownames()
List all row names
```{r}
rownames(mtcars)       # NOTE:  I used a different data frame, one with actual row names ;-j
```

# Data Wrangling with dplyr
[dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr#dplyr) is a broadly adopted package which supports data manipulation (aka data cleaning, data wrangling, data janitor, data engineering, etc.)

## tbl_df
`tbl_df()` provides a convenient summary of the characteristics of a data frame object.  This function has similarity with `str()` and many of the functions covered in the preceding section.

```{r}
tbl_df(unempdata)
```


## rename() - edit column names

In the example below, use the `colnames()` function before and after the `rename()` function so you can see the effect.
```{r}
colnames(unempdata)     # identify the existing column names
unempdata <- rename(unempdata, discriminate = `recode: any discrimination`, no_job = `lost my job`, no_clients = `removed from direct contact with clients`, promotion = `denied a promotion`)            # rename column names

colnames(unempdata)     # Proof that the names where changed by using the reassignment operator
```

## recode()

* recode to change the data values
* recode for the NA Characteristics
      + Replace "Not Applicable" with the "NA" chacter )
```{r}
unempdata$no_job <- recode(unempdata$no_job, No = "FALSE", Yes = "TRUE", "Not Applicable" = NA_character_)
```

## str_pad() - String Padding
Leading or Padding zeros
```{r}
unempdata$ID <- str_pad(unempdata$ID, 3, pad = "0")
```


## as.logical()
Change to vector data type to logical vector (i.e. TRUE / FALSE)

```{r}
class(unempdata$no_job)
unempdata$no_job <- as.logical(unempdata$no_job)
tbl_df(unempdata)
summary(unempdata)
```

## FILTER - subset rows
`filter()` can take multiple arguments (e.g. cyl >= 4, cyl <= 6)

**Note**: We're using a new data set 
```{r}
data("mtcars")		# load the onboard mtcars dataset, part of base-R 
?mtcars           # get more information about this dataset in the help pane
tbl_df(mtcars)
```

### filter() 
Make a custom data frame called "four.six" that consists of only the four and six cylinder cars
```{r}
four.six <- filter(mtcars, mtcars$cyl <8)      #filter out 8 cylinder cars and make a new data.frame "four.six"
tbl_df(four.six)                               #Alas!  now rownames
```

## Putting it together
1. gather the row names values into a vector and move that data into its own column
      a. rename the new column:  "makeModel"
2. `select()` only a few specific columns for my data frame
3. `filter()` out the 8 cylinder vehicles with select
4. `mutate()` - add a column by calculating new custom values for a new variable
```{r}
four.six <- mutate(mtcars, rownames(mtcars))                 #add the row names as a separate column
four.six <- rename(four.six, makeModel = `rownames(mtcars)`) #rename the added, auto-named column
four.six <- select(four.six, makeModel, mpg:wt)              #select only the columns wanted
four.six <- filter(four.six, cyl >= 4, cyl <=6)              # filter rows
four.six <- mutate(four.six,
  wtdisp = disp / wt
)                                                            # augment data
tbl_df(four.six)
```


## Arrange the data output
`arrange()` the data in a custom order in a data frame display
```{r}
arrange(four.six, cyl, desc(mpg), desc(hp), wt, wtdisp)
```

## Regex & Capture Groups
Now it's time for some advanced string manipulation to set the data up for [Visualization](#viz) in the next section.  String manipulation is pretty common in the world of datasmithing but it's not so easy in [R].  Of course some packages exist to help.  We won't go into too much detail right now but the following two examples enble pattern matching and capture groups which are fundamentals of [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).  However, I'll gloss over this for now as the inspired focus of [R] is statistics.  

* take the first word (make of automobile) from the makeModel column and put it in its own column
```{r}
# library(stringr)
four.six$make <- word(four.six$makeModel, 1)

# ignore this next line although it may come in handy to some.
# str_extract(four.six$makeModel, "\\w+\\s(.*)")
```

* Take all the words following the first word (model) and put that string in it's own column
```{r}
# library(stringi)
four.six$model <- stri_match_last_regex(four.six$makeModel, "\\w+\\s(.*)", cg_missing = "")[,2]

# ignore this next two lines although it may come in handy to some.
# stri_match_all_regex(four.six$makeModel, "\\w+\\s(.*)")[[1]][2]
```

# Tables - Cross Tabulations
Building [cross-tabulated](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~smarkham/resources/crosstab.htm) (Markham)[^3] tables

**Note**: New data set and examples from an [R Tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/tables.html#graphical-views-of-tables) by (Kelly Black)[^2]

## unique() - variable values  {#httpload}
`unique()` is contextually related to `table()` in that it reveals the unique values within a variable.  To  demonstrate the `table()` function, let's use an example and example data made available from Kelly Black's [R] Tutorial.
```{r}
# R Tutorial by Kelly Black is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (2015).
# http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/tables.html#graphical-views-of-tables
smokerdata <- read_csv("http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/_static/smoker.csv")
tbl_df(smokerdata)            # Note the structure of the data
unique(smokerdata$Smoke)      # Note the unique values for the Smoke variable
unique(smokerdata$SES)        # Note the unique values for the SES variable
```

## table()
As noted above, `table()` is similar to `unique()` except that it not only reveals the unique variables but it also calculates the frequency of those variables.
```{r}
table(smokerdata)            # Create a cross tablulation
table(smokerdata$Smoke)      # Gather frequency data for a single variable
```

# Visualizations {#viz}

## plot() - Scatter Plot
`plot()` will generate a scatter plot.  To demonstrate this I'll introduce a new dataset, Egar Anderson's Iris Data.  The data contains the measurements in centimeters of various flowers: variable sepal and petal measurements in length and width for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. You can find more information about this dataset by typing `?iris` in the console pane.  The scatter plot example comes from Peter Cock's guide to plotting in [R][^11] which will cover the `plot` command in greater detail. 

```{r}
data("iris")        # get the iris data
tbl_df(iris)        # get some summary characteristics of the data frame
table(iris$Species, iris$Petal.Width)   # create a cross tablulation

# scatter plot
# http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/iris_plots/
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, main="Edgar Anderson's Iris Data")
```

## hist() - Histogram
```{r}
hist(iris$Petal.Width)
```

## barplot() - Bar Plot
```{r}
sixcyls <- filter(four.six, cyl == 6)
barplot(table(sixcyls$make))          # for categorical data
barplot(table(sixcyls$make), horiz = TRUE)
```

## mosaicplot() - Mosaic Plot
```{r}
mosaicplot(table(smokerdata))
```

## ggPlot
